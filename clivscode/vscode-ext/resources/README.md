## How to Replace the Main Icon

1. Save your white logo image as `icon.png` in this directory
2. Ensure the image is 128x128 pixels for optimal display
3. Use PNG format with transparency if your logo has transparent areas
4. The image should be clear and recognizable at small sizes
5. White logos provide better visibility across both light and dark VSCode themes

## Icon Guidelines

- Keep designs simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use high contrast colors for visibility
- Test how the icon looks in both light and dark VSCode themes
- Ensure the icon represents your extension's functionality
